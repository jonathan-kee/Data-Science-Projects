# Download CSV from api /csv/prices 
- cd csv
- curl -s -X GET "https://api.fnar.net/csv/prices?include_header=true" -H "accept: text/csv" -o prices.csv
- curl -X 'GET' 'https://api.fnar.net/csv/recipeinputs?include_header=true' -H 'accept: text/csv' -o recipeInputs.csv
- copy over csv file to docker container

# Test Postgres docker connection & location
- docker exec -it postgres-container sh
- docker cp \
    ./csv/prices.csv \
    postgres-container:/tmp/prices.csv
- docker cp \
    ./csv/recipeInputs.csv \
    postgres-container:/tmp/recipeInputs.csv

# Data Engineering With DBT
## Chapter 1
When working with dbt, you will not need to write create table or create view
statements, as dbt will create them for us. It is nevertheless good to get familiar with these
basic SQL commands as these are the commands executed in the database and you will see
them if you look in the logs.

To create the TEST database and the SOME_DATA schema in it, we can use the following commands:
CREATE DATABASE TEST;
CREATE SCHEMA TEST.SOME_DATA;

### Users and roles
The following is an example of a simple setup with one role and a couple of users:
CREATE ROLE DBT_SAMPLE_ROLE;
CREATE USER MY_NAME; -- Personal user
CREATE USER SAMPLE_SERVICE; -- Service user
GRANT ROLE DBT_SAMPLE_ROLE TO USER MY_NAME;
GRANT ROLE DBT_SAMPLE_ROLE TO USER SAMPLE_SERVICE;

A more complex setup could have one role to read and one to write for each source system (represented
by a schema with the data from the system), for the data warehouse (one or more schemata where the
data is processed), and for each data mart (one schema for each data mart).

You could then control in much more detail who can read and write what, at the cost of more effort.

The below syntax is available for postgres:
SELECT * FROM ( VALUES
('IT', 'ITA', 'Italy')
,('US', 'USA', 'United States of America')
,('SF', 'FIN', 'Finland (Suomi)')
);

### Query clause order of evaluation
1) FROM and its JOIN subclause, which are used to identify the source data for the query.
2) The WHERE clause, which is used to filter out the source data that we do not want.
This is probably the most important clause for performance, because the less data a query
works on, the quicker it is. Use WHERE whenever possible to just bring in the data you need.
3) The GROUP BY clause, which groups the source data left after applying the WHERE clause and
calculates the aggregate functions on the grouped data.
4) The HAVING clause, which filters on the results of GROUP BY.
5) Partitioning of the windows and calculation of the window functions.
6) The QUALIFY clause, which filters on the results of the window functions.
7) The DISTINCT keyword, if applied to the SELECT clause, which removes duplicated rows.
8) The ORDER BY clause, which puts the resulting rows in the desired order.
9) The LIMIT clause, which caps the rows returned by the query to the desired amount.
